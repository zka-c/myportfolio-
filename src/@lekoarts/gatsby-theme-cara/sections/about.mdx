## About

> Nihao! I'm Zikang Chen, and I am now a Chinese-English translator. I got my master's degree in translation from Guangxi University, where I have systematically learned a lot of translation knowledge, studied a lot of translation theories, and have very solid translation skills. 

I have been a translator for many years and have rich experience, especially in subtitle translation. Now I have translated up to 100,000 words of subtitles. The organizations I have worked with include: Coursera, Amara, Ted, Translation Commons, and so on. I have a very good reputation in the translation industry. Recently, I have participated in many volunteer activities for subtitle translation, which makes me love translation even more. Especially subtitle translation. In the process, my translation skills have improved a lot.

It has also opened my eyes to opportunities. I think YouTube is the biggest video sharing platform in the world and certainly has a lot of Chinese viewers. But most of the English videos don't even have subtitles, let alone Chinese subtitles. If you add Chinese subtitles, I believe it will be a big improvement and win more viewers.

Let's start the cooperation!
